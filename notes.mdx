1. we have to first initialise a project using the follwoing format of command
``` go mod init <project-name>
```
this will create a go.mod file in the root of the project.

2. then we have to create a main.go file in the root of the project.

``` go
package main

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

3. then we have to run the following command to run the project
``` go run main.go
```

## packages
- In go packages are used instead of classes,there is no concept of oops in go.
- Each package in go is essentially a directory in your workspace. Each go file must belong to some package and
  it should start with the key word <b>package</b> followed by the name of the package.
- The main package is a special package in GO.An executable program must have a main package.
- IN go,the concept of package is closely tied to the directory structure of the project.
- All go files in a single directory must belong to the same package.
- The package name is the name of the directory that contains the go files.
-  matlab ek folder mai saare files hai,toh us folder ke saare files ka package name has to be the same.

- now i created a new folder called myutil and created a new file called myutil.go in it.
-  now to import the function present in myutil/myutil.go in main.go,we have to use the following convention,like 
   in the beginning,we created a module using go mod init <project-name>,so now we have to import the package using the following format
   ``` go
   import "project-name/myutil"
   ```
   and then we can use the function present in myutil/myutil.go in main.go.


IN go for a file to be executable,it must have a main function and must belong to the main package.


<b>fmt.Sprintf</b>
Returns a string - it formats the data and returns it as a string value
Does NOT print anything - it just creates the formatted string
You need to do something with the returned string (like store it in a variable, pass it to another function, etc.)

<b>fmt.Println</b>
Prints to console - it formats the data and immediately prints it to stdout (your terminal)
Returns nothing - it's a void function
Automatically adds a newline at the end

<b>fmt.Printf</b>
Prints to console - it formats the data and immediately prints it to stdout (your terminal)
Returns nothing - it's a void function
Does NOT automatically add a newline - you need to add \n manually if you want a newline
Uses format specifiers like %s, %d, %f, %t, etc. for precise formatting control

**Comparison:**
- `fmt.Sprintf` → Returns a string (doesn't print)
- `fmt.Printf` → Prints with formatting (no newline)
- `fmt.Println` → Prints with automatic newline (less formatting control)

**Example:**
```go
name := "John"
age := 25
fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", name, age)  // Prints: Name: John, Age: 25
fmt.Printf("Age: %d, Name: %s", age, name)    // Prints: Age: 25, Name: John (no newline)
```

## Variables in Go

Go provides multiple ways to declare and initialize variables. Here are the different approaches:

### 1. Explicit Type Declaration
```go
var <variable-name> <variable-type> = <variable-value>
```

**Example:**
```go
var startup string = "Textio SMS service booting up..."
var messages string = "Sending test message"
var confirmation string = "Message sent!"
```

**When to use:** When you want to be explicit about the data type or when the type might not be obvious from the value.

### 2. Short Variable Declaration (Walrus Operator)
```go
<variable-name> := <variable-value>
```

**Example:**
```go
fname := "Dalinar"
lname := "Kholin"
age := 45
messageRate := 0.5
isSubscribed := false
message := "Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing."
```

**When to use:** Most common in Go, especially inside functions. Go automatically infers the type from the value.

### 3. Multiple Variable Declaration
```go
<variable-name1>, <variable-name2> := <variable-value1>, <variable-value2>
```

**Example:**
```go
averageOpenRate, displayMessage := 50, "hi there"
```

**When to use:** When you want to declare and initialize multiple variables in a single line.

### 4. Variable Declaration Without Initialization
```go
var <variable-name> <variable-type>
```

**Example:**
```go
var count int
var name string
var isActive bool
```

**When to use:** When you want to declare a variable but initialize it later.

### 5. Multiple Variable Declaration with Types
```go
var (
    <variable-name1> <variable-type1>
    <variable-name2> <variable-type2>
)
```

**Example:**
```go
var (
    firstName string
    lastName  string
    age       int
)
```

### Key Points:
- **Scope:** Variables declared with `var` can be used at package level, while `:=` can only be used inside functions
- **Type Inference:** Go automatically infers types when using `:=` or when initializing with `var`
- **Zero Values:** Uninitialized variables get their type's zero value (0 for numbers, "" for strings, false for booleans, nil for pointers/slices/maps)
- **Reassignment:** Use `=` to reassign values to existing variables
- **Constants:** Use `const` instead of `var` for values that won't change

### Best Practices:
1. Use `:=` for local variables inside functions
2. Use `var` for package-level variables
3. Be explicit about types when it improves code readability
4. Use meaningful variable names that describe their purpose



Now if a variable is declared with an uppercase letter,it is considered a public variable and can be accessed from other packages,like it can be exported to other packages.






## User input in go

``` go
fmt.Println("Enter your name:")
var name string
fmt.Scanln(&name)
fmt.Println("Hello,", name)
```
- now we declare a variable 'name' of type string to store the user input.
- we use fmt.Println to print the message to the user asking for their name.
- we use fmt.Scanln(&name) to read the user input and store it in the variable 'name'.
- &name is a pointer to the variable 'name' which means that the value of the variable 'name' is stored in the memory address of the variable 'name'.
- we use fmt.Println to print the message to the user saying hello and the name they entered.

Now keep in mind the scan/scanln reads until the first white space character,say i give input as "John Doe",then the scan/scanln will read only "John" and not "John Doe".
TO overcome this,we will use bufio packages NewScanner or ReadString to read the user input.

``` go
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
	fmt.Println("Enter your name:")
	name, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
	fmt.Println("Hello,", name)
```
bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin) creates a new reader that reads from the standard input (console) i.e os.Stdin.
reader.ReadString('\n') reads the user input until the newline character is encountered,this allows us to read the entire input including spaces.
the _ is a blank identifier,it is used to discard the error value returned by the ReadString function.
the name variable will now contain the entire input string including the newline character.



A buffered reader is a type of reader that reads data from an underlying source,such as a file or standard input(keyboard),and stores
the data in a buffer.
The buffer is a teporary storage area in memory. BUffered readers are commonly used to improve the performance of input/output operations.


<b>bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)</b>
This creates a new buffered reader that reads from the standard input (console) i.e os.Stdin.
<b>reader.ReadString('\n')</b>
ReadString reads until the first occurrence of the delimiter (in this case, '\n') or until the input is exhausted.
It returns the data read as a string, and an error if any occurred during the read operation.
The returned string includes the delimiter character.







URL in Golang
in go the 'net/url' package provides functionalities to parse,construct and manipulate urls
urls are used to identify resources on the internet such as web pages,images and files.

1) parsing urls
The url.Parse function takes a string representation of a url and returns a url object(url.URL struct).
This allows you to breakdown a url into its individual components such as scheme,host,path and query parameters.

2) accessing url components






``` go
urlString := "https://www.google.com/search?q=golang"
url,err := url.Parse(urlString)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("error",err)
}
fmt.Println(url.Scheme)
fmt.Println(url.Host)
fmt.Println(url.Path)
```



JSON in golang
in go,encoding/json is used to encode and decode json data.
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.


How to define and use JSON in go:
1) defining a struct to represent the json data
Define a struct the represents the json data structure.
each field in the struct should have a tag that specifies the json key name.

``` go
type User struct {
	ID int `json:"id"`
	Name string `json:"name"`
	Email string `json:"email"`
}
```

2)Marshalling(encoding):
use json.Marshal to convert a struct into a json encoded byte-array.

``` go
user := User{ID: 1, Name: "John Doe", Email: "john.doe@example.com"}
jsonData, err := json.Marshal(user)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("error",err)
}
```

3)Unmarshalling(decoding):
use json.Unmarshal to convert a json encoded byte-array into a struct.

``` go
var user User
json.Unmarshal(jsonData, &user)
```

sync.WaitGroup in Golang
- sync.WaitGroup is a synchronizastion primitive in go that us used to wait for a collection of go routines to finish their execution.
- It allows you to wait for all the go routines to finish their execution before the main function exits.

How to create a simple SyncGroup
1. Your create a Sync.WaitGroup variable to keep trackof number of go routines you want to wait for.
2. For each go routine you start,you increment the WaitGroup counter by 1 using the ADD method.
3. Inside each goroutine,you call the Done method on the WaitGroup to signal that goroutine has finished its work to decrement the WaitGroup counter by 1.
4. Finally you call WAIT

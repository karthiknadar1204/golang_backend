1. we have to first initialise a project using the follwoing format of command
``` go mod init <project-name>
```
this will create a go.mod file in the root of the project.

2. then we have to create a main.go file in the root of the project.

``` go
package main

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

3. then we have to run the following command to run the project
``` go run main.go
```

## packages
- In go packages are used instead of classes,there is no concept of oops in go.
- Each package in go is essentially a directory in your workspace. Each go file must belong to some package and
  it should start with the key word <b>package</b> followed by the name of the package.
- The main package is a special package in GO.An executable program must have a main package.
- IN go,the concept of package is closely tied to the directory structure of the project.
- All go files in a single directory must belong to the same package.
- The package name is the name of the directory that contains the go files.
-  matlab ek folder mai saare files hai,toh us folder ke saare files ka package name has to be the same.

- now i created a new folder called myutil and created a new file called myutil.go in it.
-  now to import the function present in myutil/myutil.go in main.go,we have to use the following convention,like 
   in the beginning,we created a module using go mod init <project-name>,so now we have to import the package using the following format
   ``` go
   import "project-name/myutil"
   ```
   and then we can use the function present in myutil/myutil.go in main.go.


IN go for a file to be executable,it must have a main function and must belong to the main package.

1. we have to first initialise a project using the follwoing format of command
``` go mod init <project-name>
```
this will create a go.mod file in the root of the project.

2. then we have to create a main.go file in the root of the project.

``` go
package main

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

3. then we have to run the following command to run the project
``` go run main.go
```

## packages
- In go packages are used instead of classes,there is no concept of oops in go.
- Each package in go is essentially a directory in your workspace. Each go file must belong to some package and
  it should start with the key word <b>package</b> followed by the name of the package.
- The main package is a special package in GO.An executable program must have a main package.
- IN go,the concept of package is closely tied to the directory structure of the project.
- All go files in a single directory must belong to the same package.
- The package name is the name of the directory that contains the go files.
-  matlab ek folder mai saare files hai,toh us folder ke saare files ka package name has to be the same.

- now i created a new folder called myutil and created a new file called myutil.go in it.
-  now to import the function present in myutil/myutil.go in main.go,we have to use the following convention,like 
   in the beginning,we created a module using go mod init <project-name>,so now we have to import the package using the following format
   ``` go
   import "project-name/myutil"
   ```
   and then we can use the function present in myutil/myutil.go in main.go.


IN go for a file to be executable,it must have a main function and must belong to the main package.


<b>fmt.Sprintf</b>
Returns a string - it formats the data and returns it as a string value
Does NOT print anything - it just creates the formatted string
You need to do something with the returned string (like store it in a variable, pass it to another function, etc.)

<b>fmt.Println</b>
Prints to console - it formats the data and immediately prints it to stdout (your terminal)
Returns nothing - it's a void function
Automatically adds a newline at the end

## Variables in Go

Go provides multiple ways to declare and initialize variables. Here are the different approaches:

### 1. Explicit Type Declaration
```go
var <variable-name> <variable-type> = <variable-value>
```

**Example:**
```go
var startup string = "Textio SMS service booting up..."
var messages string = "Sending test message"
var confirmation string = "Message sent!"
```

**When to use:** When you want to be explicit about the data type or when the type might not be obvious from the value.

### 2. Short Variable Declaration (Walrus Operator)
```go
<variable-name> := <variable-value>
```

**Example:**
```go
fname := "Dalinar"
lname := "Kholin"
age := 45
messageRate := 0.5
isSubscribed := false
message := "Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing."
```

**When to use:** Most common in Go, especially inside functions. Go automatically infers the type from the value.

### 3. Multiple Variable Declaration
```go
<variable-name1>, <variable-name2> := <variable-value1>, <variable-value2>
```

**Example:**
```go
averageOpenRate, displayMessage := 50, "hi there"
```

**When to use:** When you want to declare and initialize multiple variables in a single line.

### 4. Variable Declaration Without Initialization
```go
var <variable-name> <variable-type>
```

**Example:**
```go
var count int
var name string
var isActive bool
```

**When to use:** When you want to declare a variable but initialize it later.

### 5. Multiple Variable Declaration with Types
```go
var (
    <variable-name1> <variable-type1>
    <variable-name2> <variable-type2>
)
```

**Example:**
```go
var (
    firstName string
    lastName  string
    age       int
)
```

### Key Points:
- **Scope:** Variables declared with `var` can be used at package level, while `:=` can only be used inside functions
- **Type Inference:** Go automatically infers types when using `:=` or when initializing with `var`
- **Zero Values:** Uninitialized variables get their type's zero value (0 for numbers, "" for strings, false for booleans, nil for pointers/slices/maps)
- **Reassignment:** Use `=` to reassign values to existing variables
- **Constants:** Use `const` instead of `var` for values that won't change

### Best Practices:
1. Use `:=` for local variables inside functions
2. Use `var` for package-level variables
3. Be explicit about types when it improves code readability
4. Use meaningful variable names that describe their purpose



Now if a variable is declared with an uppercase letter,it is considered a public variable and can be accessed from other packages,like it can be exported to other packages.
